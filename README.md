# About

This project is a implementation of a naive bays algorithm to predict if an case of covid 19 will be complicated

The dataset usagede in this progect is [COVID-19 Symptoms Checker](https://www.kaggle.com/iamhungundji/covid19-symptoms-checker)

In the repository the file [my_classifier.pickle](https://github.com/yago1404/naive_bayes_covid/blob/master/my_classifier.pickle) is the model pre-training, if you wanna training again, delete this file and run the code.
